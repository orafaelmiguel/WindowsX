This project aims to automate the configuration and optimization of Windows 10 for maximum FPS and gaming performance using shell scripts.

The project is still under development and currently has the following features:

- CPU optimization at boot time
- Deactivation of useless services at boot time
- XMP status checking in the BIOS
- Deactivation of Windows hibernation
- TCP/IP optmization
- Checking and updating drivers to the latest version

## Network 

Optimization of TCP/IP protocols using `netsh`.

- Increase the size of TCP buffers
- Enables "ECN" (Explicit Congestion Notification) for reduced packet loss
- Adjusts "RSS" (Receive Side Scaling) for better CPU usage
- Disables "Nagle's Algorithm", reducing latency in games
- Improves Windows Scaling Heuristics to optimize bandwidth
- Adjust congestion window and other settings for lower latency

These settings are advanced and may affect your network. If you experience problems, restore default settings with:
```
powershell.exe -Command "netsh int tcp reset"
```

## Drivers Check and Update

This optimizer includes an automated process to check for outdated drivers and update them using PowerShell.

- Scans for outdated drivers using `Get-WindowsDriver` and `pnputil`
- Retrieves the latest drivers from Windows Update.
- Automatically installs updates for hardware components such as GPU, chipset, network adapters, and audio drivers.
- Check for missing or outdated drivers.

If an updated driver causes issues, you can roll back using:
```
pnputil /enum-drivers
pnputil /delete-driver <driver_name.inf> /uninstall
```

GPU drivers (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel) should be updated through their official software for best results.

## Windows Boot

Maximum hardware performance and disabling of useless processes during boot.

- Ensures all CPU cores are used at boot time
- Faster startup and system responsiveness
- Helps eliminate bottlenecks caused by Windows default settings
- Better system stability, using manufacturer-tested memory profiles
- Check BIOS and activate XAMP for higher RAM speeds
- Disables unnecessary services to free up RAM and CPU at boot time
- Less energy consumption and latency at boot time


## Disabled Services List

Below is a list of unnecessary Windows services disabled by this optimization script.

⚠ **Note:** If you rely on any of these services, you may want to enable them manually after running the optimization script.

## Intel Scripts

Optimization scripts for Intel CPUs that aim to improve processor performance by adjusting settings related to frequency, voltage and power management.

Separate executable file for optional use inside `/intel/bin/output`

- Adjust CPU voltage to improve performance or reduce power consumption
- Adjusts the CPU operating frequency to ensure that the processor operates at a constant and stable speed, avoiding clock jitter
- Desabilita os C-states da CPU, o que impede que o processador entre em modos de baixa frequência
- Installing Intel XTU for manual CPU optimization if you want to advance the optimization

## Installation

1 - To run scripts on Windows you'll have to set your Execution-Policy to Unrestricted, using the following command:

From an Administrator Powershell prompt:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

2 - Clone this rep
```
git clone https://github.com/orafaelmiguel/Windows10-Gaming-Optimizer.git
cd Windows10-Gaming-Optimizer
```

3 - Install Git Bash in https://git-scm.com/downloads

4 - Run executable file :3
